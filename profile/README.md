## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About the Mahtools group
Mahtools is a public group dedicated to writing open source tools for [Riichi Mahjong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_mahjong) as well as select other board games such as [Koi Koi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koi-Koi). 

The primary goal of the group is to provide groups of Mahjong players tools to aid both general play and teaching the game to others. 

We want players to have high quality games of Mahjong while also being able to spread the game to others. 

## üìù Ongoing projects
Here is a quick tour of the projects Mahtools has to offer:
